# Array Quadruplet
# Given an unsorted array of integers arr and a number s, write a function findArrayQuadruplet that finds four numbers (quadruplet) in arr that sum up to s. Your function should return an array of these numbers in an ascending order. If such a quadruplet doesn’t exist, return an empty array.

# Note that there may be more than one quadruplet in arr whose sum is s. You’re asked to return the first one you encounter (considering the results are sorted).

# Explain and code the most efficient solution possible, and analyze its time and space complexities.
